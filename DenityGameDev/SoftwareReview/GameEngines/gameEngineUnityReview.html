				<h1> Unity 3D Game Engine </h1>
			
				<!-- Site Content -->
				
				<p>The Unity 3D game engine is a popular game engine that is widely used by independent 
					game developers in recent years due to major improvements and updates.</p>

				<p>The Unity 3D game engine is a fairly well-tooled game engine that is able to develop most 
					genres of games.</p>
				
				<p>The game engine has a lot of pros to it as it is meant to be highly modifiable.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Easily adaptable to any genre of game.</li>
					
					<li>The ability to develop games for a variety of platforms including PC, Xbox One, 
						Android, IPhone, and Nintendo Switch.</li>
						
					<li>Easy to navigate User Interface.</li>
					
					<li>Includes c#, an easy to learn programming language.</li>
					
					<li>Built-in marketplace for creators to buy and download content.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h1>User Interface</h1>
				
				<a href="./gameEngineImages/unityUserInterface.png" target="_blank">
					<img src="./gameEngineImages/unityUserInterface.png" alt="Unity User Interface" class="contentImage">
				</a>
				
				<p>The User Interface is cleanly laid out and is easy to navigate. If the User Interface is 
					not comfortable for the user, they can drag and place windows into their own sections of the 
					screen if they do not like the current layout.</p> 
				
				<p>By default, the left pane is the hierachy where entities are placed into the scene of the game.</p>
				
				<p>The right side is the Inspector where settings of a certain entity can be modified. For this 
					instance, the picture above is the player entity's settings.</p>
				
				<p>The bottom tabs are Project and Console. Project is the collection of levels, scripts, audio, 
					graphics, and entities that are in the project.</p> 
				
				<p>The Console is usually a blank space that will show errors and messages depending on what 
					is happening in the game.</p>
				
				<h1>The Unity Asset Store</h1>

				</a>
				
				<p>The Unity Asset Store is the built-in marketplace where game developers can buy many 
					different kinds of assets including scripts, graphics, and models.</p>
				
				<p>The Unity Asset Store can be accessed via two ways. It can be accessed by the "Asset Store"
					tab on the center viewport in the Unity 3D game engine application. It can also be accessed 
					via Unity's website.</p>
				
				<h1>Opinion</h1>
				<p>My opinion about the game engine used to be mixed prior to the major update that the engine 
					has had since early 2018.</p>
				
				<p>Prior to 2018, Unity 3D had a stigma attached to it as independent game developers would 
					over-saturate the market with games that all shared the same assets across all of them. 
					These tended to be referred to as "asset flips" or "asset store games". The lack of 
					post-processing effects and graphical capabilities also did not help the public opinion of it.</p>
					
				<p>After 2018, my opinion changed to be more positive as the developers of the engine started to focus 
					on development of post-processing, quality, and functionality. Individuals began to also develop 
					more advanced plugins and assets for the asset store allowing the other developers to develop more 
					advanced games.</p>
